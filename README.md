# Statistics project: length measurement device
Using a potentiometer to create a length measuring device.

## code
Arduino was used to read the change in voltage as the potentiometer spins and translate that into a value for the length.

## CAD
Used autoCAD 3D to make the mechanical components that would move along the length to be measured and translate that into rotary motion which would then turn the potentiometer.
